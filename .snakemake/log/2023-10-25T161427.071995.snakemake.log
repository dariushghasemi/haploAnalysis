Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule get_locus in file /home/dghasemisemeskandeh/projects/haploAnalysis/Snakefile, line 8:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
genotype/PDILT/PDILT.vcf.gz
Removing output files of failed job get_locus since they might be corrupted:
genotype/PDILT
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
