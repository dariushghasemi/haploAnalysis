MissingOutputException in rule get_dosage in file /home/dghasemisemeskandeh/projects/haploAnalysis/Snakefile, line 28:
Job 6  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
genotype/IGF1R_dosage.txt
genotype/IGF1R_variants.list
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
